HOW THE KYC PROCESS WORKS INTERNALLY

Let’s break the process into simple steps.

STEP 1 — User uploads ID + selfie + liveness video.

Our AI verifies:

Face matches ID

ID is not forged

Video is real human (anti-deepfake)

Document is valid

Nationality + age rules

Sanctions/PEP check

Detect if user used this ID before (duplicate prevention)

STEP 2 — We extract ONLY verification results

Example results:

age ≥ 18

nationality = IN

sanctioned = false

faceMatchScore = 97%

human = true

document validity = true

STEP 3 — Zero-Knowledge circuit generates zkProof

A SNARK/STARK circuit encodes:

Verified = true

Age ≥ 18

Not sanctioned

Human verified

Unique identity

The circuit produces:

proof.hash

publicSignals

This is the ONLY thing sent on-chain.

STEP 4 — Mint zkPassport (Soulbound NFT) on Polygon

The NFT stores:

isVerified: true

ageFlag: true

sanctionFlag: false

humanFlag: true

identityHash: <encrypted>

ALL personal data is thrown away.

STEP 5 — Link zkPassport to a stealth identity

We use ERC-5564 stealth addresses:

generate a stealth wallet

link the passport to it

user never reveals real identity wallet

no one knows which wallet belongs to which person




Tech Stack Required

Here is the complete tech stack for OblivionID:

🔵 BLOCKCHAIN (On-Chain Layer) — Polygon

Used for:

zkPassport (Soulbound NFT)

Proof verification

Storing encrypted identity commitments

Storing boolean attributes (isAdult, isVerified, isHuman, etc.)

Stealth address (ERC-5564) use

Tech needed:

Polygon PoS or Polygon zkEVM

Solidity

Hardhat / Foundry

OpenZeppelin libraries

zkVerifier contract

ERC-5564 stealth address system

🔴 ZK LAYER (Zero-Knowledge Proof Engine)

Used to create proofs such as:

“Age ≥ 18”

“Document valid”

“Not sanctioned”

“Human verified”

“Identity uniqueness”

Tech needed:

circom / snarkjs (circuits)

zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs

Groth16 proving system (fast & cheap)

Or advanced:

Noir (optional)

Polygon's zkEVM verifier precompile (optional)

🟣 OFF-CHAIN BACKEND (KYC + AI Layer)

Used for:

Document processing

Face match

Liveness detection

Deepfake detection

Age extraction

Nationality extraction

Sanction list check

Generating ZK witness

Storing temporary encrypted data

Tech needed:

Node.js (Fastify/Nest.js)

Python (AI models)

Identity verification SDKs

OCR (Tesseract or Vision API)

Deepfake detection AI model

Face recognition model (Facenet, ArcFace)

🟡 FRONTEND (User Interface Layer)

Used for:

Wallet connect

KYC upload

Dashboard

Minting zkPassport

Connecting to dApps

Tech needed:

Next.js

React

Tailwind CSS

Wagmi + Viem

Web3Modal / RainbowKit

File upload components





DB Options:
MongoDB
But once the zkPassport is minted:

❗ ALL user’s personal data must be deleted.










bro create teh aurthetication profile verything end to end from sigin to veeything and we see when user lick on get start then we will ask him to their detail and then comple thei rprofile and after that we will redirect them to thier dahbord perdonal dahbor dinwhich he can view thei rporifle and also update teh credtinal he have upload 
and also add some more conetct in hoem page and otehr page there is lot lot error also and imporve teh ui bro i really dont liek the ui and make it good adn also run te npm run build and if any error then fix that error and give teh websiet final ui touch see i want you to really imporve teh ui anhd withextar contect eveything with make it perfect and add some good feture and make sure that the also amke sure that teh smart corntatc an d fornetdn is linek dan dweveything is wokring on chain and with godo ui and logical routes funcational can you cheak imporve teh websiet 

see thgsi is teh project detaili want and make it perfect add some
