🛡 OBLIVIONID: Private KYC + Zero-Knowledge Identity Passport
6
⭐ WHAT IT DOES (Simple Explanation)

OblivionID allows a user to prove their identity without revealing their identity.

Example:

A user can prove:

“I am 18+”

“I passed KYC”

“I’m not on a sanctions list”

“I’m a unique human (not bot)”

WITHOUT revealing:

Name

Address

Age

ID picture

Real wallet

Nationality

Any documents

This is done using zero-knowledge proofs + stealth addresses + off-chain KYC verification.

⭐ What Problem Does It Solve?

Today, dApps have two bad choices:

❌ 1. Ask for full KYC → Users hate it, privacy lost
❌ 2. Ask for nothing → They risk legal problems + bots abuse

OblivionID gives the perfect middle solution:

→ dApps confirm rules are satisfied
→ Users keep 100% privacy

This is a massive need in DeFi, gaming, RWAs, lending, and DAOs.

🧠 HOW IT WORKS (Technical, but simple)

There are three layers:

1️⃣ Off-Chain KYC + AI Verification Layer

The user completes a one-time verification:

Upload ID

Face scan

Liveness detection

Anti-deepfake AI checks

Document authenticity check

This happens off-chain (secure, not on blockchain).

After verification, the system generates:

A zero-knowledge proof confirming identity attributes

A verification certificate (not the document itself)

2️⃣ On-Chain zkPassport (Soulbound NFT)

After verification, user mints a zkPassport SBT on Polygon.

This NFT contains:

✔ Hashes of their verification
✔ Zero-knowledge proof
✔ Boolean attributes (true/false):

isAdult

isVerified

isHuman

isNotSanctioned

isUniqueIdentity

❌ No personal info stored
❌ No images
❌ No documents
❌ No name

This passport is non-transferable → tied to user.

3️⃣ Stealth Identity Layer (ERC-5564)

User’s public wallet is NOT connected to their KYC.

Instead, OblivionID:

Generates a stealth identity address

Links zkPassport to stealth identity

Keeps the relationship hidden

So nobody can see:

Which wallet belongs to which KYC’d person

Who is behind a transaction

This is identity privacy with compliance.

👤 USER POINT OF VIEW (Simple, clean flow)

Let's walk through it exactly how a user experiences it.

🧍User POV — Step-by-Step Experience
STEP 1 — User visits OblivionID website

They see:

“Verify your identity privately. No one will ever see your data.”

They connect their wallet.

STEP 2 — Complete KYC (One-time)

User uploads:

ID

Selfie

Video for liveness detection

AI checks:

Fake image detection

Deepfake detection

Tampered document detection

Country + age validation

After 1 minute:

"Verification complete."

STEP 3 — Mint zkPassport (On Polygon)

User clicks Mint zkPassport.

This creates a Soulbound NFT (non-transferable) that stores:

Verified = true

Age ≥ 18 = true

Sanctioned = false

Unique human = true

But does NOT store:

Name

Age

Country

Photo

Document

The NFT is fully privacy-preserving.

STEP 4 — Connect zkPassport to Stealth Identity

The system automatically generates:

A stealth identity address

A private reference key

User gets:

“Your identity is now completely unlinkable to your wallet.”

So even if someone sees:

Their trades

Their DeFi usage

Their DAO voting

They cannot link it to the KYC identity.

STEP 5 — Use dApps Privately

User goes to a platform:

Lending

Gaming

Governance (DAO voting)

Token launchpad

RWA marketplace

NFT mint with anti-bot rules

Airdrop protection

They click:

“Verify with OblivionID”

The dApp receives:

True/False values (Is user verified? Is user 18+?)

A zkProof (cannot be faked)

The dApp NEVER gets personal data.

STEP 6 — User Interacts with dApps With Full Privacy

User can:

✔ Borrow without revealing identity
✔ Enter 18+ games without showing age
✔ Claim tokens without bots
✔ Vote privately in DAOs
✔ Join KYC-required platforms anonymously
✔ Access RWA platforms without oversharing

Everything is:

permissionless

private

trustless

compliant

🎯 REAL EXAMPLES (to make it SUPER clear)
Example 1 — User wants to join a DeFi lending protocol

Traditional:
❌ must submit KYC
❌ reveals identity
❌ privacy gone

OblivionID:
✔ Proves "Verified"
✔ Proves “Not sanctioned"
✔ Proves “Human"
✔ dApp accepts instantly
✔ No personal info exposed

Example 2 — User wants to mint an age-restricted NFT collection

Traditional:
❌ User must submit ID

OblivionID:
✔ Provides zkProof that user is 18+
❌ Does not show actual age
❌ Does not show name
✔ Mint allowed

Example 3 — User wants to vote in a DAO but privately

✔ DAO checks “unique human”
✔ DAO checks “verified identity”
❌ Does not see user wallet
❌ Does not see any metadata
✔ User votes anonymously
